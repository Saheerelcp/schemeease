‚úÖ Project Title:
Government Scheme Eligibility & Benefit Tracking Wallet

üìò Abstract:
In India, thousands of crores are allocated for public welfare schemes every year, yet a significant portion of the population remains unaware of the benefits they are entitled to. This digital platform aims to solve this real-world problem by helping citizens‚Äîespecially rural and economically weaker sections‚Äîdetermine their eligibility for various central and state government schemes based on personal and socio-economic details.

The system offers a dynamic eligibility checker, personalized benefit tracking dashboard, document management vault, and tools for social workers to manage scheme applications for multiple households. Unlike complex ML-based platforms, this project uses deterministic rule-based logic stored in configurable JSON tables, ensuring full transparency and control.

Built using Django (Python backend) and React.js (frontend), this platform is designed to be extendable, region-aware, and secure, targeting a pressing civic need with practical full-stack capabilities.
